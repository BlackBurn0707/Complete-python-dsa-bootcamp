Of course. Here are the notes from the video lecture on understanding recursion through the factorial example.

### **Topic: Understanding Recursion with Factorial**

This lesson uses the classic problem of calculating the factorial of a number to provide a deep, visual understanding of how recursion works.

-----

### **1. The Mathematical Foundation of Factorial**

The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n\!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$.

**Formula:**
$n\! = n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times 1$

**The Recursive Insight (Recurrence Relation)**
The key to solving this recursively is to notice that the solution to the problem depends on the solution to a smaller version of the *same problem*.

$n\! = n \\times \\underbrace{((n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\dots \\times 1)}\_{(n-1)\!}$

This gives us the **recurrence relation**:
$$factorial(n) = n \times factorial(n-1)$$

-----

### **2. Implementing Factorial Recursively**

#### **The Initial (Flawed) Attempt**

Based directly on the recurrence relation, a simple recursive function can be written.

```python
def factorial(n):
    # This function is missing a base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# print(factorial(5)) # This will cause an error
```

This code fails with a **`RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`**. This happens because the function never stops calling itself, leading to an infinite chain of calls (`5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow 0 \rightarrow -1 \rightarrow \dots`).

#### **Sidebar: Python's Recursion Limit**

  * To prevent a program crash from a "stack overflow," Python has a built-in recursion limit (usually 1000).
  * You can check and change this limit using the `sys` module:
    ```python
    import sys
    # Check the current limit
    print(sys.getrecursionlimit()) # Output: 1000
    # Set a new limit
    # sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)
    ```

#### **The Solution: Adding a Base Case**

A recursive function must have a **base case**â€”a condition where it stops calling itself and returns a known value. For factorial, the base case is when $n=1$, since $1\! = 1$.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base Case: The condition to stop the recursion
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Recursive Step: The function calls itself with a smaller problem
    small_answer = factorial(n - 1)
    answer = n * small_answer
    return answer

print(factorial(5))
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

### **3. Visualizing the Recursive Process: The Call Stack**

Here is what happens behind the scenes when `factorial(5)` is called:

#### **Phase 1: The Recursive Calls (Building the Stack)**

Each function call waits for the result of the next call.

1.  `factorial(5)` is called. It needs the result of `factorial(4)`. It waits.
2.  `factorial(4)` is called. It needs the result of `factorial(3)`. It waits.
3.  `factorial(3)` is called. It needs the result of `factorial(2)`. It waits.
4.  `factorial(2)` is called. It needs the result of `factorial(1)`. It waits.

#### **Phase 2: The Base Case is Hit**

5.  `factorial(1)` is called. The `if n == 1:` condition is `True`. The function **returns `1`** without making any more calls.

#### **Phase 3: The Return Journey (Unwinding the Stack)**

The results are now passed back up the chain of waiting functions.
6\.  `factorial(2)` receives the return value `1`. It calculates `answer = 2 * 1` and **returns `2`**.
7\.  `factorial(3)` receives the return value `2`. It calculates `answer = 3 * 2` and **returns `6`**.
8\.  `factorial(4)` receives the return value `6`. It calculates `answer = 4 * 6` and **returns `24`**.
9\.  `factorial(5)` receives the return value `24`. It calculates `answer = 5 * 24` and **returns `120`**.

This final value of `120` is returned to the original caller.

### **4. The "Leap of Faith" - Moving Beyond Manual Tracing**

Manually tracing the entire call stack like this is great for understanding but is not practical for every problem. We don't need to do it every time.

The reason we can trust recursion to work is because of a mathematical concept called the **Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI)**. This principle provides the formal proof for why we can assume our recursive calls will work correctly, as long as we have a valid base case and a correct recursive step. This will be explored in the next lesson.
