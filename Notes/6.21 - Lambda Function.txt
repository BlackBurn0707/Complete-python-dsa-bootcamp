The lecture introduces lambda functions in Python, explaining their anonymous nature, syntax, and primary use cases for short, single-expression operations, especially in conjunction with higher-order functions like map.

Lambda Functions in Python
1. Introduction to Lambda Functions
	• Definition: Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.
	• Anonymous Function: This means they are functions without a name. While regular functions are defined using def and given a name, lambda functions are not.
	• Key Characteristics:
		○ Can have any number of arguments.
		○ Can have only one expression (meaning one single logical operation or calculation).
		○ The expression is automatically returned. You do not use the return keyword.
	• Common Use Cases:
		○ For short, one-time operations that don't require a full def function definition.
		○ As arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), which accept other functions as parameters.
	• Syntax:
Python

lambda arguments: expression
2. Creating and Calling Lambda Functions
Let's compare a regular function with its lambda equivalent.
	• Example 1: Simple Addition
		○ Regular Function: 
Python

def add(a, b):
    return a + b
print(add(2, 3)) # Output: 5
		○ Lambda Function: 
Python

addition_lambda = lambda a, b: a + b
print(addition_lambda(2, 3)) # Output: 5

Explanation: lambda a, b defines two arguments. : a + b is the single expression. The result of this expression is implicitly returned. The lambda function is assigned to the addition_lambda variable, which can then be called like a regular function.
	• Example 2: Even Number Check
		○ Regular Function: 
Python

def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0
print(is_even(24)) # Output: True
		○ Lambda Function: 
Python

is_even_lambda = lambda num: num % 2 == 0
print(is_even_lambda(24)) # Output: True

Explanation: lambda num takes one argument. : num % 2 == 0 is the single Boolean expression.
	• Example 3: Sum of Three Numbers
		○ Regular Function: 
Python

def sum_three(x, y, z):
    return x + y + z
print(sum_three(12, 13, 14)) # Output: 39
		○ Lambda Function: 
Python

sum_three_lambda = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
print(sum_three_lambda(12, 13, 14)) # Output: 39
3. map() Function with Lambda
The map() function is a higher-order function that applies a given function to all items in an input list (or other iterable) and returns an iterator of the results.
	• map() Syntax: map(function, iterable)
	• Why use map() with lambda? It allows for applying a transformation to each element of a collection concisely, without writing a full def function or a for loop.
	• Example: Squaring Numbers in a List
		○ Traditional Approach (using def and for loop, or list comprehension): 
Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# Using def function
def square(num):
    return num**2
squared_numbers_def = [square(n) for n in numbers] # or a for loop
print(squared_numbers_def) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

# Using list comprehension directly
squared_numbers_lc = [n**2 for n in numbers]
print(squared_numbers_lc) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]
		○ Using map() with lambda: 
Python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
squared_numbers_map_lambda = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)

# map() returns a map object (an iterator), so convert to list to see results
print(list(squared_numbers_map_lambda)) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]

Explanation: lambda x: x**2 is the function applied to each x from the numbers list. map() handles the iteration internally.
		
4. Higher-Order Functions (Brief Mention)
	• The lecture briefly touches upon higher-order functions, which are functions that either: 
		○ Take one or more functions as arguments (like map, filter, sorted).
		○ Return a function as their result.
	• map() and filter() will be discussed in more detail in upcoming videos.

Conclusion:
Lambda functions are a powerful tool for writing short, single-expression, anonymous functions in Python. They significantly improve code conciseness and are particularly effective when used in conjunction with higher-order functions like map() and filter() for transformations and filtering of data collections. This allows for cleaner and often more efficient code than traditional def functions for simple operations.
Are you excited to explore map() and filter() with lambda functions in more detail, or would you like to revisit any other function concepts?
