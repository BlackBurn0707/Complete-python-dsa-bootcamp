Of course. Here are the notes from the video lecture on counting the digits of a number using recursion.

### **Problem: Count the Number of Digits Recursively**

Write a recursive program to count the number of digits in a given integer `n`.

  * **Example 1:** `n = 123`, Output: `3`
  * **Example 2:** `n = 31584`, Output: `5`

-----

### **1. The Recurrence Relation**

The key to solving this recursively is to break the problem into a smaller, identical problem. We can observe that the number of digits in any number `n` is simply **1 plus the number of digits in the rest of the number** (i.e., the number `n` with its last digit removed).

  * **Logic:** `count_digits(123) = 1 + count_digits(12)`
  * **General Form:** `count_digits(n) = 1 + count_digits(n / 10)`

To remove the last digit from an integer in Python, we can use integer division: `int(n / 10)` or `n // 10`.

#### **Recursion Tree Example**

A simple way to visualize this breakdown is with a recursion tree:
`123` â†’ `12` â†’ `1`

-----

### **2. The Base Case**

Defining the correct base case is the most critical step.

  * **Simplest Case:** For any single-digit number from 1 to 9, the count of digits is **1**.
  * **Edge Case for `n=0`:** The number 0 has one digit. However, in the context of our recurrence relation (`n // 10`), a single-digit number like `9` will become `0` in the next recursive call. We must handle `0` correctly to avoid miscounts.

#### **Handling a Faulty Base Case**

It's important to have a specific base case for single-digit numbers. If we only had a base case like `if n == 0: return 1`, consider the input `n=9`:

1.  `count_digits(9)` is called. It's not 0.
2.  It calls `count_digits(9 // 10)`, which is `count_digits(0)`.
3.  `count_digits(0)` hits the base case and returns `1`.
4.  The original `count_digits(9)` call receives `1` and calculates `1 + 1`, returning an incorrect answer of `2`.

**The Correct Base Cases:**

1.  If the number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), return 1.
2.  If the number is 0, return 0 (or 1, depending on problem requirements, but 0 works better with the recurrence relation). It's always good to clarify this with an interviewer.

### **3. The Python Code**

```python
def count_digits(n):
    # Base Case 1: For handling the number 0.
    if n == 0:
        return 0 # Or 1, if a single 0 should be counted as one digit.

    # Base Case 2: For any single-digit number.
    if n >= 1 and n <= 9:
        return 1

    # Recursive Step: 1 + the number of digits in the rest of the number.
    small_answer = count_digits(n // 10)
    return 1 + small_answer

# --- Examples ---
print(f"Number of digits in 123 is: {count_digits(123)}")
print(f"Number of digits in 9 is: {count_digits(9)}")
print(f"Number of digits in 987654 is: {count_digits(987654)}")
```

**Output:**

```
Number of digits in 123 is: 3
Number of digits in 9 is: 1
Number of digits in 987654 is: 6
```
