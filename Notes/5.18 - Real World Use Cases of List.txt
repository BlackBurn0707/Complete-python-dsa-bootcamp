The lecture demonstrates practical, real-world applications of lists in Python. It highlights how lists are used to manage various types of data in common scenarios.

Real-World Examples: Using Lists in Python
Lists are one of the most versatile and frequently used data structures in Python due to their ordered and mutable nature. This lecture showcases several common applications.
1. Managing a To-Do List
Lists are ideal for tracking tasks in a simple to-do application, allowing for easy addition, removal, and checking of items.
	• Initial To-Do List Creation: 
Python

to_do_list = ["Buy groceries", "Clean the house", "Pay bills"]
	• Adding New Tasks (.append()): New tasks are easily added to the end of the list. 
Python

to_do_list.append("Schedule meeting")
to_do_list.append("Go for a run")
	• Marking a Task as Complete (.remove()): When a task is finished, it can be removed from the list. 
Python

to_do_list.remove("Clean the house")
	• Checking for Remaining Tasks (in operator and iteration): You can check if a specific task is still pending and iterate through the remaining tasks. 
Python

if "Pay bills" in to_do_list:
    print("Hey, don't forget to pay the utility bills!")

print("\nTo-Do List Remaining:")
for task in to_do_list:
    print(f"- {task}")
	• Output (after operations): 
Hey, don't forget to pay the utility bills!

To-Do List Remaining:
- Buy groceries
- Pay bills
- Schedule meeting
- Go for a run

This example illustrates how basic list operations (append, remove, in operator, and iteration) can form the core logic for a task management system.

2. Organizing Student Grades
Lists are excellent for storing and performing calculations on numerical data like grades.
	• Storing Grades: 
Python

grades = [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]
	• Adding a New Grade: 
Python

grades.append(95)
	• Calculating Average Grade: Python's built-in sum() and len() functions are very useful here. 
Python

average_grade = sum(grades) / len(grades)
print(f"Average Grade: {average_grade:.2f}") # Format to 2 decimal places
	• Finding Highest and Lowest Grades: The max() and min() functions quickly retrieve these values. 
Python

highest_grade = max(grades)
lowest_grade = min(grades)
print(f"Highest Grade: {highest_grade}")
print(f"Lowest Grade: {lowest_grade}")

This demonstrates how lists simplify statistical calculations on collections of data.

3. Managing Inventory
Lists can track items in stock for scenarios like e-commerce or retail.
	• Initial Inventory: 
Python

inventory = ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges", "Grapes"]
	• Adding New Stock: 
Python

inventory.append("Strawberries")
	• Removing Sold Items: 
Python

inventory.remove("Bananas") # Item "Bananas" is sold
	• Checking Stock Availability: 
Python

item_to_check = "Oranges"
if item_to_check in inventory:
    print(f"{item_to_check} are in stock.")
else:
    print(f"{item_to_check} are out of stock.")
	• Displaying Current Inventory: 
Python

print("\nUpdated Inventory:", inventory)

Output (after operations): 
Oranges are in stock.

Updated Inventory: ['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Grapes', 'Strawberries']

This example showcases how lists handle dynamic changes in inventory items, including adding new products and removing sold ones.

4. Collecting and Analyzing User Feedback (Assignment)
This task encourages using lists to collect textual feedback and then applying list iteration and string methods to analyze it.
	• User Feedback Collection: 
Python

feedbacks = [
    "Great service!",
    "Very satisfied.",
    "Could be better.",
    "Excellent experience.",
    "Not happy with the service."
]
# Add another feedback
feedbacks.append("Amazing support!")
	• Analyzing Positive Feedback (using a loop and string methods): 
Python

positive_feedback_count = 0
for comment in feedbacks:
    # Convert comment to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    if "great" in comment.lower() or "excellent" in comment.lower() or "amazing" in comment.lower():
        positive_feedback_count += 1

print(f"\nPositive feedback count: {positive_feedback_count}")
print("User feedback comments:")
for comment in feedbacks:
    print(f"- {comment}")

Example Output: 
Positive feedback count: 3
User feedback comments:
- Great service!
- Very satisfied.
- Could be better.
- Excellent experience.
- Not happy with the service.
- Amazing support!

This demonstrates how lists can store diverse data types (strings here) and be combined with control flow (for loop, if statement) and string methods (.lower(), in) for basic text analysis.

Conclusion:
These examples highlight the versatility of lists in Python for handling common data management tasks in various applications. Their ability to store ordered, mutable collections of diverse data types makes them an indispensable tool in programming.
